# Life Expectancy Evolution: Between Past and Future

This visualization illustrates the evolution of life expectancy over time, exploring changes between the past, present and future. It also delves into the effectiveness of life expectancy as a measure of years of life between people within the same country, drawing insights from [Peltzman's study(2009)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.23.4.175). Moreover, it offers readers an opportunity to explore in-depth the factors influencing changes in life expectancy, leaving room for their own interpretations and analysis.

## Project Description

This data visualization project focus on the evolution of life expectancy worldwide and utilizes the Vega-Lite library for creating maps and diagrams. The objective was to demonstrate advanced data visualization techniques acquired during the semester, showcasing their versatility in a novel context. With Vega-Lite library, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we meticulously crafted a publicly accessible web page hosted on GitHub. 

## Visualization Overview

**[Work in Progress]**

The visualization portrays the changes in life expectancy, highlighting historical data and projecting future expectations. Through this visual representation, viewers can gain a deeper understanding of the trends and potential future trajectories of life expectancy. It also explores the inequity of life expectancy to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the trends.
